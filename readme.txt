Hello, 
I'm Tharun Reddy, i did my best in the past 1 week to complete this task and i learnt alot during the completion of the task.Because I am new to the tech stack and it took some time for me to learn this tech stack, I couldn't implement the filters feature.As a fresher i tried to work hard and to learn new things and complete the work on time, but i know we can do many more things in the task , i hope i can learn more things if i get selected. I hope you like the progress i made in completion of the Task.


i used mongodb for database
flask
HTML
CSS
D3.js and Chart.js
